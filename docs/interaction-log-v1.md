# Seurat Interaction Log v1

Seurat can write a local, append-only JSON Lines log of semantic user
interactions. The log supports usage auditing, offline preference profiles,
visualization ranking, and workspace-organization recommendations. Logging by
itself does not change visualization selection behavior.

Logging is disabled unless `SEURAT_INTERACTION_LOG_DIR` is set. Seurat creates
the mode-0700 directory, a pseudonymous `.seurat-profile-id`, and one or more
mode-0600 session files. Existing directories retain their permissions.
`SEURAT_INTERACTION_LOG_MAX_MB` controls segment rotation and defaults to 64
MiB. Rotation never deletes old segments.

```bash
export SEURAT_INTERACTION_LOG_DIR=/path/to/private/seurat-logs
export SEURAT_INTERACTION_LOG_MAX_MB=64
python app.py campaign.aca
```

## Event envelope

Every line is one JSON object with these required fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | Integer event schema version; v1 is `1`. |
| `event_id` | Unique event identifier. |
| `event_sequence` | Monotonic sequence within the session. |
| `timestamp_utc` | ISO-8601 UTC wall-clock time. |
| `elapsed_session_ms` | Monotonic elapsed session time. |
| `user_profile_id` | Pseudonymous ID stored in the log directory. |
| `session_id` | Unique Seurat process-session identifier. |
| `campaign_version_id` | Hash of campaign path and file-version metadata. |
| `event_type` | Versioned semantic event name. |
| `source` | UI or controller path that caused the event. |
| `model_version` | Selection or capture policy version. |
| `payload` | Event-specific JSON object. |

V1 records session lifecycle, normalized query application and clearing,
visualization assignment/change/removal, workspace tab and pane operations,
grid layout and cell operations, saved/loaded/final workspace snapshots,
timeline driver changes, and recommendation outcomes.

Visualization assignments include the complete supported candidate set, the
chosen default, the active normalized query ID, and the semantic workspace
location. Safe variable characteristics such as dimensionality, type, shape
bucket, and time-varying status are included when available. Manual changes
reference the original assignment event and record the elapsed time since
assignment.

Recommendation events distinguish generation, display, acceptance, dismissal,
and application failure. They contain structured action context, not model
prompts or arbitrary executable content.

## Query data

`query.applied` records the validated action plan, compiled query filters,
source filters, result counts, origin, and target. It does not record the raw
manual query string or natural-language assistant request. Subsequent
visualization and workspace events carry the active `query_id` where relevant.

## Workspace snapshots

Snapshots contain the pane tree and split ratios, ordered pane/tab identifiers,
grid dimensions and sizing, semantic cell contents, cell spans, source
fingerprints, visualization settings, and timeline driver. Tab titles are not
recorded. The active grid is captured from live Trame state; inactive tab grids
come from the workspace layout. A final sanitized snapshot is recorded before a
clean application exit.

Snapshots and events intentionally exclude:

- campaign absolute paths;
- workspace save/load paths;
- raw query and assistant text;
- tab titles;
- ADIOS arrays and scalar payloads;
- images, movies, previews, and data URLs;
- arbitrary plugin option values;
- transient browser rendering state.

Variable IDs and structured numeric query operands remain present because they
are required to learn variable- and task-specific behavior. Logs should be
stored in a private location and should not be uploaded without a separate
sanitization and consent process.

## Validation and audit

Run the bundled audit over a file or directory:

```bash
python -m seurat.learning.audit /path/to/private/seurat-logs
```

The audit validates envelopes, ignores an incomplete final line left by a
process interruption, and reports sessions, queries, visualization assignments
and changes, saved snapshots, common visualization transitions, and variables
that co-occur in saved tabs.

Raw logs are immutable training input. Future label builders and models must
write separate versioned artifacts rather than changing v1 events.

See [Preference Intelligence v1](preference-intelligence-v1.md) for profile
building, offline evaluation, and runtime suggestion modes.
